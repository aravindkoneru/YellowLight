YellowLight
===========

A simple physics simulator made to collect data for a physics lab. 

The Problem
===========

We were tasked with the problem of determining the lengths of different cycles of a traffic light. The problem was highly open-ended and we were only given a few parameters. (Link to lab coming soon)

Solution
========

This computer simulation is our solution to the complex problem of determining the optimal cycle for a traffic light. Although the simulation is fairly simplistic and does not take into account many real world variables (weather, time of day, road location, traffic production, etc.), it does provide a physics based estimate for the cycle. 

TODO
====

- [x] ~~Assume that the driver continues at a constant velocity~~
- [x] Create graphical representation of simulation 
- [ ] Simulate the cycles of the other lights (red, green)
- [x] Simulate the intersection 
- [x] Determine optimal cycle 
- [x] ~~Run tests with other velocities~~
