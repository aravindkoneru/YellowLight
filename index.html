<a name="yellowlight" class="anchor" href="#yellowlight"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>YellowLight</h1>

<p>A simple physics simulator made to collect data for a physics lab. </p>

<h1>
<a name="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h1>

<p>We were tasked with the problem of determining the lengths of different cycles of a traffic light. The problem was highly open-ended and we were only given a few parameters. (Link to lab coming soon)</p>

<h1>
<a name="data" class="anchor" href="#data"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h1>

<h3>
<a name="50mph-road-with-constant-light-time-5-seconds" class="anchor" href="#50mph-road-with-constant-light-time-5-seconds"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>50mph Road with Constant Light Time (5 seconds)</h3>

<p><img src="https://github.com/aravindkoneru/YellowLight/blob/gh-pages/images/50mph%20constant%20time.png?raw=true" alt="Image">
<strong>Analysis:</strong> <em>The data shows that the 5 second time limit is good enough for the cars to stop at the intersection. Most of the cars stopped regardless of their velocity and acceleration. The real determining variable appears to be the distance the cars are from the light when they hit the brakes. Further trials are required to determine how the distance from the light affects the cars.</em> </p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/aravindkoneru/YellowLight/blob/gh-pages/images/50mph%20constant%20time%20and%20distance.png?raw=true" alt="Image">
<strong>Analysis:</strong> <em>The 250 ft distance and 5 second yellow light cycle appear to be ideal. It works really well since the majority of the cars are able to stop safely with plenty of time to spare. It may be worth looking into to see at what point the cars can no longer safely stop and use that to determine the length.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/aravindkoneru/YellowLight/blob/gh-pages/images/30mph%20constant%20time%20%285s%29.png?raw=true" alt="Image">
<strong>Analysis:</strong> <em>Looking at the data, its obvious that 5 seconds is too much time to give for this yellow light. The data shows that all the samples stopped before 3 seconds. More experimentation has to be done in order to determine the optimal time for a yellow light.</em></p>

<h3>
<a name="30mph-road-with-constant-light-time-3-seconds" class="anchor" href="#30mph-road-with-constant-light-time-3-seconds"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>30mph Road with Constant Light Time (3 seconds)</h3>

<p><img src="https://github.com/aravindkoneru/YellowLight/blob/gh-pages/images/30mph%20constant%20time%20%283s%29.png?raw=true" alt="Image">
<strong>Analysis:</strong> <em>Three seconds appears to be the ideal time for a yellow light. All the cars can stop in time and there doesn't seem to be any sort of problem with stopping within the distance.</em></p>

<h1>
<a name="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution</h1>

<p>This computer simulation is our solution to the complex problem of determining the optimal cycle for a traffic light. Although the simulation is fairly simplistic and does not take into account many real world variables (weather, time of day, road location, traffic production, etc.), it does provide a physics based estimate for the cycle. </p>
