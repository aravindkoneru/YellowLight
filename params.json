The problem was highly open-ended and we were only given a few parameters. (Link to lab coming soon)\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n========\r\n\r\nThis computer simulation is our solution to the complex problem of determining the optimal cycle for a traffic light. Although the simulation is fairly simplistic and does not take into account many real world variables (weather, time of day, road location, traffic production, etc.), it does provide a physics based estimate for the cycle. \r\n\r\nCredit\r\n======\r\n\r\n[Aravind Koneru] (https://www.facebook.com/aravind.b.koneru)\r\n* [github] (github.com/aravindkoneru)\r\n\r\n[Jonathan Chen] (https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.chen.7169709?fref=ts)\r\n\r\n[Eric Zhang] (https://www.facebook.com/eric.zhang.5667901?fref=ts)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
